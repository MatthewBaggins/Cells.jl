## TODO

- [ ] Docstrings, detailed documentation
- [ ] GUI, more customization of display and visualization
- [ ] More automata
  - [ ] Other discrete 2D automata (different rules and grid geometries)
  - [ ] Continuous automata
- [ ] An algorithm for finding self-sustaining patterns for any given cellular automaton
